This repo is meant to hold the customizations and provide technical support for the Commander X16 forums. 

## Commander X16
The Commander X16 is a new 8-bit Microcomputer being developed by 8-Bit Productions (aka The 8-Bit Guy). The team released an emulator pretty early in the process, 
and since then, a community has developed, centered around programming games and music applications for the computer.

The official forum is here: https://www.commanderx16.com/

This repository is for bug and issue tracking for the forums.
